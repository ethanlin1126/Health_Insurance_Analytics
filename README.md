# Health Insurance Analytics
## Health Insurance Analytics
Project Overview:<br>
  This analysis aims to explore the key factors influencing health insurance costs while providing clear visual insights into health-related behaviors. Utilizing Alteryx, I developed a data pipeline to analyze pertinent categories that may impact insurance expenses, including weight, smoking status, and BMI. Furthermore, I calculated the average insurance charges for each category to understand their effects better. To present these insights more effectively, I used Tableau to create visual dashboards, allowing for a clearer and more intuitive understanding of how various factors contribute to differences in health insurance costs.
